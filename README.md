# RoboUmps

This machine learning project explores a new problem facing baseball: how will electronic strike zones affect the game? Utilizing principal component analysis and clustering methods of classification, <b>RoboUmps</b> crafts a profile for the pitches who will be helped the most or hurt the most by the advent of robot umpires in Major League Baseball. Check out the jupyter notebook to see the data science behind my conclusions. 

Using Statast pitch data from 2015 to 2019, I found four contributing factors that bias umpires toward a more liberal zone: <b>velocity, spin rate, role,</b> and <b>handedness</b>. For the full write-up, check out the official post for this project on <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/04/which-pitchers-should-fear-robot-umpires.html">MLB Trade Rumors</a>, the industy's leading hot stove website.

- Who Got The Most Gifted Strike Calls In 2019? <a href="https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/05/the-pitcher-to-receive-the-most-extra-strikes-in-2019-was.html">This post</a> follows up on the original using the database for umpire accuracy metrics to examine the the pitcher who receieved the most gifted strikes in 2019. Why did he get so many calls? And how did those extra strikes affect his performance?
