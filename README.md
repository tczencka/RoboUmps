# RoboUmps

This project attempts to use machine learning to solve a new problem facing baseball: how will electronic strike zones affect the game? Utilizing Principal Component Analysis and clustering methods of classification, RoboZone crafts profiles for the pitches who will be helped the most or hurt the most by the advent of robot umpires in Major League Baseball.
